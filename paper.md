# A first course in git

Authors: Stavrina Dimosthenous

## Introduction

We are learning how to use Git in the command line today, 2024-10-23.
We are using Gerard Capes' teaching notes for this course - [link here](gcapes.github.io/git-course).

I am finding this quite enjoyable.

Let's get hyped for the afternoon.
